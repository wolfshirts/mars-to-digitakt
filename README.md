# mars-to-digitakt
Just got a digitakt, I'm using samples from mars packs. The packs take a lot of space.
This tool takes an extracted zip, parses through all the directories and builds a zip
which contains all the c samples, and tracks without a root note.

The directory should be an unzipped samples from mars.

To use python3 mars_digitakt.py /your/directory/here
